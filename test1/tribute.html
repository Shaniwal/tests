<p>A man with simple personality, was born in Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu in the year 1931. he worked as an aeronautical engineer with DRDO & ISRO. Dr. Kalam served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. During his lifetime, he has won many prestigious awards and honours being a renowned scientist, thinker,philosopher and a teacher.His journey to become the ‘missile man of India’ had its trials and tribulations and yet he attained his goal because of his singleminded devotion. After he completed his engineering, he joined DRDO’s Aeronautical Development Establishment as a scientist. He also designed a helicopter for the Indian Army in the beginning of his career. Kalam was still not sure of his career choice. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). In ISRO, he headed the project of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III). The growth of Kalam began here from a mere scientist to become the missile man of India itself. He headed several successful launches and started gaining recognition in relevant circles.Kalam was the chief executive of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme. Under this mission, Kalam helped to develop Agni and Prithvi missiles. Kalam was also the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Secretary of DRDO and to the Prime Minister. The Pokhran-II tests were conducted in the same period. These subsequent successes made Kalam one of the most popular scientists in media.</p>
<p>
    Dr. Kalam loved imparting knowledge to the youths through teaching, writing and motivational quotes. He always believed that educated youth formed the pillars of any developing nation. Education according to him is the principal driving force of personal growth. No wonder that in spite of having so many titles, Dr. Kalam still loved being addressed as a teacher!

The missile will travel at the speed of 8,575 kmph and will have seven times the speed of Mach 7. It is being developed by Indo Russian unit BrahMos Aerospace. There couldn’t be a greater tribute to a man who has been responsible for such a progress in missile engineering in India.</p>
